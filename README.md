## Code Snippets :computer::monkey:

Here you will find a non-exhaustive list of procedures functions and other code snippets for various programming languages. The individual snippets are categorized according to usage but are functionally independent.

I created this compilation to give back to the ones, who have been willing to enrich the internet with their contributions. Most snippets were written by myself. Some were taken from the community and edited. If you find yourself reinventing the wheel, in a particular programming task, I might got you covered :wink:

### Programming languages
- Python 3
- VBA (mainly intended for Excel)
- C

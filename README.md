## Code Snippets

Here you will find a non-exhaustive list of procedures functions and other code snippets for various programming languages. I created this compilation to give back to the ones, who have been willing to enrich the internet with their contributions. Most snippets were written by myself. Some are at least partially taken from the community :blue_heart:. If you find yourself reinventing the wheel, in a particular programming task, I might got you covered :wink:

### Programming languages
- Python 3
- VBA (mainly intended for Excel)
- C
